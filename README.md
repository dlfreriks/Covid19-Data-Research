Usage - ignore the "access denied" error, the R engine wants a parameter (Country) to start it's forecasting, Sheet 1 is using ARIMA, Sheet 2 is Holt-Winters, Sheet 4 is just US daily information... (unfortunately there is not enough time-series data history at this time to run a projection at the State level).
